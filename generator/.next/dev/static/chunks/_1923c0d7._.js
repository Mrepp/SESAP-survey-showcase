In this special archive, students who identify themselves as members of one or more of these communities offer their narrative testimonies and unique insights to illuminate opportunities for program and institutional transformation to incorporate the agency of more diverse perspectives and advocate for diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice in engineering education and the engineering profession."

The term auto-ethnography designates the agency exercised by each of the participants appearing in the archive as the authors of their own stories that center on their experiences of culture, identity, and power. The term testimonio further designates the type of narratives offered here as accounts that bear witness and testify about events, including injustices, that have powerfully impacted the lives of individuals and communities. We believe these accounts have important implications not only for the School of EECS at Oregon State University but also for institutions of engineering education and for the discipline of engineering more broadly. Each of the recordings appearing in the archive is approximately 20-30 minutes in length and was created using Zoom. The individual authors tell their own stories and make selections about most important aspects to include about their experiences based on a basic framework of guiding prompts focusing on: their identity; influential community and cultural background leading up to their educational experiences; accounts of the intersection of identity, community, culture, power, and their experience in engineering education programs; strengths they bring to these programs as individuals and members of their communities, and recommendations for future changes or actions in support of students from underserved communities. After a brief introduction from the SESAP project organizer, each of the individual authors primarily appears speaking on their own for the duration of the recording."
