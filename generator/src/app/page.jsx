                The EECS Student Experience Story Archive Project (SESAP) collects the narrative statements of students from underserved and marginalized communities. 
                Video testimonies are recorded and submitted by students in order to document their experiences in EECS programs. These are then analyzed in order to 
                highlight ways in which university and industry leaders can better support engineering students from underserved communities.
